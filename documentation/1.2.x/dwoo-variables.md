title: List of $dwoo and other reserved variables
---

Variable names are limited to /[a-z0-9_]/i, which means all alpha-numeric characters plus the underscore character, they are case-sensitive.  
Also, as an advice, I would recommend that you do not use any variable name starting with an underscore ('_') since should I need to add a magic variable I will be using such $_foo named variables, that way everyone avoids bad surprises.

The following are reserved variables:

* **$dwoo**
* **$dwoo.parent**
* **$_key**
