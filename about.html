					<p>The idea came from the fact that <a href="http://www.smarty.net/" target="_blank">Smarty</a>, a well known template engine, is getting older and older.</p>
					<p>It carries the weight of it's age, having old features that are inconsistent compared to newer ones, being written for PHP4 its Object Oriented aspect doesn't take advantage of PHP5's more advanced features in the area, etc.</p>
					<p>Hence Dwoo was born, hoping to provide a more up to date and stronger engine.</p>
					<p>So far it has proven to be faster than Smarty in many areas, and it provides a compatibility layer to allow developers that have been using Smarty for years to switch their application over to Dwoo progressively.</p>
					<p><strong>Dwoo 2</strong> is the new version of this template engine developed by <abbr title="David SANCHEZ">myself</abbr>.</p>
					<p>This new version embedded new features of PHP like <strong>Namespaces</strong>, <strong>CamelCase</strong>,<strong>...</strong> so it need at least PHP 5.3 to run.</p>
