                Dwoo (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English" target="_blank">/diː-wu:/</a>)
                (stylized as dwoo) is a modern, flexible and oriented object template engine for PHP, facilitating the
                separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic.<br><br>

                In many aspects, dwoo is compatible with Smarty's templates and plugins because dwoo's author based it
                on the general ideas that Smarty has introduced to the world of web development.<br><br>

                Started in early 2008 by <a href="//github.com/Seldaek" target="_blank">Jordi Boggiano</a>, the idea
                came from the fact that Smarty is getting older and older. It carries the weight of it's age, having
                old features that are inconsistent compared to newerones, being written for PHP4, it doesn't take
                advantage of PHP5's more advanced features in the area.<br><br>

                Dwoo's template engine takes advantage of the new features offered by PHP5. So it is a well-written,
                object-oriented template engine that allows easier and faster development compared with Smarty and still
                it is compatible enough to allow developers using Smarty to make a smooth transition to dwoo.<br><br>

                Since 2013, a new author push the project back on track following a time of non-activity of the project.
                New releases has been pushed online to make dwoo more stable than before, fixing issues, making
                package available on <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/dwoo/dwoo" target="_blank">packagist.org</a>
                for everyone and adding new features.<br><br>

                Dwoo template engine is released under a modified <a href="/about.html#/license">LGPLv3 license</a>.

                        As we continue to develop complex web applications, it is becoming more important to have a wall
                        of separation between <em>application logic</em> and <em>display logic</em> so that back-end
                        developers and front-end developers can collaborate on the same areas of the website without
                        having to step around each other’s code.<br><br>
                        A template engine solves this situation by providing a concise syntax front-end developers can
                        use to display data prepared by back-end developers. The front-end developers experience the
                        benefit of clean and pretty views they can read and modify, and in-turn the back-end developers
                        can free themselves of the responsibility of maintaining the views.<br><br>
                        It’s a win-win.
