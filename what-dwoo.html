            <p>
                Dwoo is a <strong>PHP5</strong> and <strong>PHP7</strong> compatible Template Engine that was started
                in early 2008 by <a href="//github.com/Seldaek" target="_blank">Jordi Boggiano</a>.<br><br>
                The idea came from the fact that <b>Smarty</b>, a well known template engine, is getting older and
                older. It carries the weight of it's age, having old features that are inconsistent compared to newer
                ones, being written for PHP4 its Object Oriented aspect doesn't take advantage of PHP5's more advanced
                features in the area, etc.<br>Hence Dwoo was born, hoping to provide a more up to date and stronger
                engine. So far it has proven to be faster than Smarty in many areas, and it provides a compatibility
                layer to allow developers that have been using Smarty for years to switch their application over to Dwoo
                progressively.

                        As we continue to develop complex web applications, it is becoming more important to have a wall
                        of separation between <em>application logic</em> and <em>display logic</em> so that back-end
                        developers and front-end developers can collaborate on the same areas of the website without
                        having to step around each other’s code.<br><br>
                        A template engine solves this situation by providing a concise syntax front-end developers can
                        use to display data prepared by back-end developers. The front-end developers experience the
                        benefit of clean and pretty views they can read and modify, and in-turn the back-end developers
                        can free themselves of the responsibility of maintaining the views.<br><br>
                        It’s a win-win.
