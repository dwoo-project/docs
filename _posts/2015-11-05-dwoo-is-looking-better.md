Since I took over this unmaintained project 2 years ago, I put online a new website and focus on a 2.x version without having the success I expected in my development, by lack of time.
<!-- more -->
After a while of inactivity and accumulation of issues, it's now time to get this project back-on-tracks!

The first step was to put online a complete official website redesigned, including the full documentation of Dwoo.
Like a lots of people asked me before, documentation of the branch **1.x** is now back on the documentation section.

For now, I can't say much about development in the near future, I can just affirm that:

* Dwoo 1.x will no more evolving, this version is still **UNMAINTAINED**
* Dwoo 2.x is still in beta and will stay like that!
* IF I start to work again on this project sources, I will go directly for a **Dwoo 3.x** supported only by **PHP7**.

I will inform you about that in this blog in the beginning of 2016!
